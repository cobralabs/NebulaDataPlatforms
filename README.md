# NebulaDataPlatforms
NebulaDataPlatforms is an enterprise-grade, scalable data ecosystem designed to handle high-velocity data streams and complex analytical workloads. Much like a celestial nebula—the birthplace of stars—NDP serves as the foundational environment where raw data is gathered, processed, and transformed into "stellar" insights.
